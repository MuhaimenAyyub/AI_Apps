# About
In this beginner friendly repository I will create mini projects using python.

## 1. Trip Planner:
Code a trip planner in which you ask user to choose the trip details.  
The project is little bit modified but the main idea was adopted from the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithjoshoffical).
