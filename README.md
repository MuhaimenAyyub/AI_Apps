# About
In this beginner friendly repository I will create mini projects using python.

## 1. Trip Planner:

The project is little bit modified but the main idea was adopted from the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithjoshoffical).

## 2. BMI Calculator:
Code a BMI calculator by using two functions.

## 3. Timer:
